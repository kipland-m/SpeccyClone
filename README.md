# SpeccyClone
A "clone" of the popular program "Speccy" used to display the hardware information of your system. Being built in Python for data management and C++ Qt for GUI applications

The purpose of this program will be to concisely display computer information to the user
including but not limited to:

- Hardware temperatures (CPU, GPU)
- Storage Space (Drive info,)
- Fan Speed?

The current development guideline is to build a functioning prototype in terminal form
(terminal based text sheet displaying hardware infomation) the data that will be used
will be obtained using Python, which we will use to display the data in the terminal prototype
and manipulate it into a readable format.

Then, once a functioning terminal-based prototype is finished, we will build a C++ based GUI application using Qt
to properly display this data to the end user.
